# MerakiExampleScripts

Assorted scripts using the Meraki dashboard API.

AddStandardAdmins: Using an example organization's org ID, copy its org-level admins to another org.

add_rf_profiles: Add standardized RF profiles to a ton of networks at once. Extremely helpful if you're managing a large number of wireless networks for any reason, b/c modifying the standard profiles is invisible to the API.
