# MerakiExampleScripts

Assorted scripts using the Meraki dashboard API. Primarily posted for sharing on the Meraki Community Forum.

### AddStandardAdmins: 
Using an example organization's org ID, copy its org-level admins to another org.

### add_rf_profiles: 
Add standardized RF profiles to a ton of networks at once. Extremely helpful if you're managing a large number of wireless networks for any reason. Modifications to the base RF profiles are invisible to the API.

### import-exportSwitchPorts.py
Import switch port config from or export switchport configs to a file, as JSON. Useful when copying switchport configs between switches on separate networks.
